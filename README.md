This project predicts the price of diamonds based on their physical and categorical attributes (like carat, cut, color, clarity, etc.) using Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). It also performs market segmentation using K-Means clustering to classify diamonds into distinct value categories such as Basic, Premium, and Luxury.
